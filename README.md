# Dog breed identification with Inception Resnet V2 Network  
This project creates a convolutional neural network based on Inception Resnet V2 for the purpose of image classification.  
The project uses Stanford Dogs dataset that contains 20,580 categorised images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. The dataset is downloaded from Stanford Vision and Learning Lab.
